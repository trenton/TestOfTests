Project to evaluate and demonstrate capabilities of different
Scala testing frameworks. 

This project will have the following:

* It should have methods that can return booleans integers strings
  and collections for exercising match assertions. [done]

  Util.reflect, Util.negate, Util.reflect

* It should have a method that can raise exceptions for exercising if
  exception was raised. [done]

  calling Util.negate('x') will throw IllegalArgumentException

* It should have methods that take an object as an argument and call
  methods on it for exercising mocks/stubs.

  interface: Twitter
  implementation: TwitterImpl
  data object: Tweet

* It should have a method that can perform a calculation like addition
  for exercising use of mock/stub with custom method.
